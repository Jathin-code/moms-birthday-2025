You work harder than anyone I know, yet you carry kindness like it’s air. Your guidance is the compass I use when the world gets confusing. You are the most special person in my life. I am so lucky to be your son. If I could fold the sky and give it to you, it still wouldn’t be enough. You taught me to stand tall and always care — your lessons are my armor. The way you work for our family makes me want to be a better person every day. I see your sacrifices in the little things, and I will never forget them. I love you more than any words on this page — but here’s a start.";
